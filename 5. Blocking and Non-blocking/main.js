// 1. Client Request Phase

// Clients send requests to the Node.js server
// Each request is added to the Event Queue
// 2. Event Loop Phase

// The Event Loop continuously checks the Event Queue
// Picks up requests one by one in a loop
// 3. Request Processing

// Simple (non-blocking) tasks are handled immediately by the main thread
// Complex/blocking tasks are offloaded to the Thread Pool
// 4. Response Phase

// When blocking tasks complete, their callbacks are placed in the Callback Queue
// Event Loop processes callbacks and sends responses
